                Hi everyone. First of all little intrduction.
                This task is a part of our monitoring strategy and with using
                of custom metrics we can show not only quantity of liambda
                invocation, but usefull data too. 
                For example payment cancelled monitoring can provide to us quantity
                of payment cancelled events, quantity of money that was refaund when
                payment was cancelled and it currency.
                And at grafana We can choose currence of cancelled payment for example...
                And here we can see quantity of payment cancelled. 
                And also we can use all base grafana standard features as period of monitoring.
